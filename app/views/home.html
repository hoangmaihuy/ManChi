  <h3>What is ManChi?</h3>
  <p>
    It's a shorthand of <b>Man</b>darin <b>Chi</b>nese, a simple web application built on AngularJS, Bootstrap and gh-pages for hosting.
  </p>
  <h3>What can ManChi do?</h3>
  <p>
    First of all, this is an alpha version and I have many ideas, features and tweaks to develope in the near future. Forgive me if this application retards.
  </p>
  <p>
    This application concept is from the dictation test on my Chinese class that students have to hear the pronunciation and write chinese characters (Hanzi) into paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that's why ManChi's Writing is here to help, reading out loud the pronunciation and checking if you write it correctly.
  </p>
  <h3>How can I learn Chinese characters?</h3>
  <p>
    All the new words and writing words are from a book called "Hanyu Jiaocheng". <br /> If you are learning that book so you can practice writing character by this application.
  </p>
  <h3>How can I type Chinese characters?</h3>
  <p>
    It's a non-sense question if you are Chinese, just skip it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use Pinyin input keyboard but I don't recommend because this application would be helpless using that method. My concept creating this project is using handwriting input methods. Just draw the right strokes and they will do the rest for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can follow the instruction
    <a href="http://www.pinyinjoe.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to install handwriting keyboard on your platform. <br /> Or if you're using an Android phone, just download
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.handwriting.ime&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Handwriting Input</a>.
